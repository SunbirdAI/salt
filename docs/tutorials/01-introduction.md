Project Leb, inspired by the Luo word for “language”, is dedicated to the seamless integration of Sunbird AI Language Technology. It empowers developers to create machine learning models for Neural Machine Translation (NMT), Speech-to-Text (STT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and other language applications. By bridging Africa’s diverse languages and dialects, Leb connects ideas, cultures, and technologies through an inclusive, accessible, and human-centric platform.
